//test
//Natours:
//1)start with server.js
//creating a server and listen for incoming requests
//2)app.js (application-level middleware )
//and mounting the router that matches the mount path
//3) ...Router.js, (router-level middleware),
//and pile matching middlewares
//4) ...Controller.js , use piles mw and send back the reponse (in the last mw)

//Actually, in this project we create a web server (server.js)
//and an API that handles the requests(routes & controllers)
